#### What is the modification?

It is a packaged .cls version of the original template, with some changes,
less flexible but maybe more convenient to use.

To use it , first put the .cls file (as well as the WYC logo) into the folder where you are working,
or your texmf-local path. Then begin the .tex file with \documentclass{templateWYC}
